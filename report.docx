Implement support for file operations (open, rename, create, delete) in the Srcdb webview tree component.

Context:
- This is for the Quartz VSCode extension.
- The Srcdb webview displays a tree of modules, folders, and files retrieved from Sandra DB.
- The left column acts as a navigation menu; selecting a module displays its folders/files.
- We need the webview tree to behave similarly to the VSCode file explorer, but using our custom proxy + Sandra APIs.

Requirements:
1. Enable right-click context menu actions for:
   - Open file
   - Rename file/folder
   - Delete file/folder
   - Create new file
   - Create new folder

2. For each action, call the appropriate Sandra DB endpoint via the existing proxy APIs:
   - Use `SourceLocator` + `ProxyManager` for backend communication.
   - Validate staging area ownership before mutating any file.
   - Ensure correct error handling and notification messages.

3. After each mutation:
   - Refresh only the affected subtree if possible.
   - Otherwise fall back to reloading the full module tree.

4. UI requirements:
   - Use `<vscode-tree>` and `<vscode-tree-item>` components.
   - Preserve expand/collapse state when refreshing.
   - Ensure the tree renders correctly for nested folder structures at any depth.

5. Code architecture:
   - Put all webview logic inside the existing Srcdb React component.
   - Add message handlers in `srcdbViewProvider.ts` to receive commands from the webview and call proxy APIs.
   - Use the existing bi-directional postMessage contract.

6. Acceptance Criteria (from JIRA):
   - A user viewing the Srcdb webview can perform file operations from the tree.
   - The left column navigates modules and their children.
   - All operations correctly update Sandra DB and reflect in the UI.

Please generate:
- React code for the tree including context menus.
- Message passing handlers for each tree action.
- Updates to the extension host to call Sandra APIs.
- Helper utilities for refreshing subtrees cleanly.
- TypeScript code only, no placeholders—produce runnable and idiomatic Quartz extension code.
