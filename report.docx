So we have a custom vscode extension with several major functionality for developers. We work at Bank of America, where everything is built in-house, so we build a custom extension that integrates with our Sandra database.  We have several custom keyboard shortcut keys and would like to provide a page for users to reference, showing these keyboard shortcuts. This page will be constantly updated so it should be automatically sync from the package.json file. This will be a webview page. Currently we have the extension side of the code which typescript and then we have a webview side in react. We want the page to be similar to that of default vscode "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcut" page. It has a search filed to search commands, and four columns in table (Command, Keybinding, When, Source(We could change this to descition since it will be one sourc)). For the table we have the vscode elements library imported so we can use the table component https://vscode-elements.github.io/components/table/#resizable-columns. These are some features that I came up with but if add whatever elese you feel will be best and more advance to have a complete implementation:

Dynamic updates: Can automatically refresh when shortcuts change
Rich formatting: Better styling and interactivity than markdown
Search/filter: Easy to add search functionality for large shortcut lists
Consistency: Can match your bank's design system
Live data: Reads directly from package.json, no manual updates needed
